In a land far far away, where the rivers tasted like wine, and the clouds fell like buzzy-rainfalls;
once at sunrise and once at when the sun sheds its evening silks. 
There lived three fuzzy bears with frost-white coats. 
Bela, the oldest one, wore a yellow beret to hide his two strands of hair. 
Theresa, the chubbier of the two, loved the taste of morning snow on her tongue.
Walta was the youngest, and so he still played with the falling clouds under the sky-streams of borialis of crayons.
Every full-moon, the fireflies mused the starts so close to the land, the three fuzzy bears could reach it––only if they could jump six-point-two feet up. 

Theresa, enjoyed ice cream for breakfast every day.
On the first day of May, she had 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream with rainbow sprinkles

later on they went to play in the bouncy house
And they lived hapily ever after.
