In a land far far away, where the rivers tasted like wine, and the clouds fell like buzzy-rainfalls;
once at sunrise and once at sunset. 
There lived three fuzzy bears with frost-white coats. 
Bill, the oldest one, wore a yellow beret to hide his two strands of hair. 
Theresa, the chubbier of the two, loved the taste of morning snow on her tongue.
Noel was the youngest, and so he still played with the falling clouds.

Theresa, enjoyed ice cream for breakfast every day.
On the first day of May, she had 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream with rainbow sprinkles
