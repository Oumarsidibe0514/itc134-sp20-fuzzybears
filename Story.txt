In a land far far away, where the rivers tasted like wine, the rains honeyed like sweet morning oats, and the clouds fell like buzzy-rainfalls;
once at sunrise and once at sunet. 
There stood a home, in that crooked umbrella-like mushroom of snow and ice, lived three fuzzy bears with frost-white coats. 
Bela, the oldest one, wore a yellow beret to hide his two strands of hair. 
Theresa, the chubbier of the two, often cleaned her cate-eyed glasses against her furry bottom, loved the taste of morning snow on her tongue.
Walta was the youngest, and so he still played with the falling clouds under the sky-streams of borialis of crayons.
Every full-moon, the fireflies mused the starts so close to the land, the three fuzzy bears could reach it––only if they could reach three-point-five feet up. 

Theresa, enjoyed ice cream for breakfast every day.
On the first day of May, she had 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream with rainbow sprinkles.

Even though veggies come first, they continued to eat sweets all day
Later on, they all went to play in the bouncy house.

Later on, they all went to play in the bouncy house.
And they lived hapily ever after.
